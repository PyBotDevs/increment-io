<h1 align="center">increment.io, an extremely simple, yet functional counting Discord bot.</h1>

## About

increment.io is a Discord bot made in Python for the purpose of counting number from 1 to ♾️. 

You can set it up in any channel, and in any server you want, and customize the bot to your liking. And since this bot is licensed with GPL-3.0, you can download the bot's code and customize it to your liking.

## Progress
* Slash commands: Implementation of slash commands is work-in-progress. For now, you can use the traditional prefix-type commands.
* Codebase: Since close-source development of this bot was halted for nearly **2 years**, the bot's code is quite obsolete. Efforts to migrate the bot from `discord.py` to `PyCord` will be made.
* Uptime: The bot was abandoned for about 2 years, which means its hosting server will need some serious maintenance and fixing to get back on the right pace. This will be *hopefully* resolved soon.
